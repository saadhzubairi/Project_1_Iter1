# ResNet Implementation Notes

## Overview
A concise guide to implementing ResNet for a deep learning project. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, focusing on key components and training details.

## ResNet Architecture
ResNet (Residual Network) is a type of artificial neural network that utilizes residual blocks to improve training efficiency and accuracy. The key idea is to use shortcut connections to skip one or more layers.

## Key Components
- **Residual Block**: The building block of ResNet, which includes a skip connection that bypasses one or more layers.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Used to extract features from the input images.
- **Batch Normalization**: Applied to normalize the output of the convolutional layers.
- **Activation Function**: Typically ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is used.
- **Pooling Layers**: Used to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.

## Training Details
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10
- **Optimizer**: Adam or SGD
- **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy Loss
- **Epochs**: Typically 100-200
- **Batch Size**: Commonly 32 or 64

## Steps to Implement
1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. **Model Definition**: Define the ResNet architecture using residual blocks.
3. **Compilation**: Compile the model with the chosen optimizer and loss function.
4. **Training**: Train the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
